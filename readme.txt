<h3>Do you have hosting business?</h3>

<p>cPanel does not provide 2-step verification login facility. So, to keep away hackers, system locks down admin's or hacker’s computer’s IP address, if he or she provides wrong passwords for 3 times. Then s/he can’t see website or cPanel from that device.</p>

<p>To regain the access, client normally sends an email to hosting service provider from the ‘Administrative Email address’ to unlock IP. But the question is, how could a client knows own IP ?</p>

<p>So the Hosting company should display visitor’s IP address at the contact page or support page of their official website, that client can easily find out own IP address, and send it.</p>

<p>See the screenshot, and know how it looks like ...</p>
